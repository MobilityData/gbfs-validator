A [General Bikeshare Feed Specification](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs) dataset validator

## Introduction

The Canonical GBFS Validator is a tool to check the conformity of a GBFS feed against the [official specification](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/gbfs.md).
It validates feeds up to GBFS version 3.0.
This tool is built using the [JSON Schemas](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs-json-schema), and the site is powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The schemas in `gbfs-validator/versions/gbfs-json-schema` is a git submodule of https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs-json-schema.

## Run the app

The validator is developed to be used “online” (hosted with a lambda function).

1.  Open https://gbfs-validator.mobilitydata.org
2.  Enter the feed’s auto-discovery URL
3.  If needed, select the version. If not specified, the validator will pick the version mentioned in the `gbfs.json` file
4.  Select file requirement options (free-floating or docked)
5.  Click the “Validate me !” button, and see the validation results below

## Validation rules

The validation rules are listed in [RULES.md](/RULES.md)
